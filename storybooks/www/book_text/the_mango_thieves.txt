A long time ago, there were four little boys.

1

They were studying at primary school.

2

The boys used to go to school with out taking breakfast.

3

They used to dose in class because of hunger.

4

One day, they decided to escape from school to a nearby place and look for something to eat.

5

After crossing to a nearby place, they saw a bigger mango tree which was full of ripe mangoes.

6

The boys looked at each other and smiled. 
“Ah! We have been very hungry but now we can eat,” said one little boy.

7

All ran to the mango tree, picked some mangoes from it, smiled and started eating.
Do you know what they forgot to do?

8

While eating, the owner of the mangoes came walking in big strides. 
“Who has given you my mangoes?” asked the man.

9

As soon as they heard that voice, the boys ran as fast as they could and hid somewhere.
They whispered to each other, “Sh! No shouting, no coughing, and no talking!”

10

The owner of the mangoes made an alarm,
“wa a a la la la, wa a a la la la, here are the thieves.

11

The boys were caught. They were taken to school and their parents were called. 
The teachers and the school children all gathered for a meeting.

12

The boys were punished. 
Each got ten strokes and repented not to steal anything again.
