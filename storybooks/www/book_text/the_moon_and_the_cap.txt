The Moon and the Cap

All of us went to the fun fair.

1

Father bought brother fancy glasses.
Mother bought me a bright blue cap.
The baby got sugar candy.

2

On the way home, a very strong wind came.
It blew my cap away.

3

My cap got stuck on a branch of a big old tree.

4

I cried a lot.
And I did not eat my dinner.

5

Later that night, the moon came up. 
It looked at my cap in the big old tree.

6

The moon tried on my cap. 
It smiled happily.
I had to smile too.

7

After school the next day, my mother gave me a shiny new red cap.
"The moon sent it," she said.

8

That night, both the moon and I wore our caps and smiled.
We were happy.

9

Do you think the sun needs a hat?

10

Guess which cap I am wearing today!
