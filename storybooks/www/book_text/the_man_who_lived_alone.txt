The man who lived alone


There was a man who didn’t want to live close to his neighbors. 
And he also didn’t want his wife to visit the homes of her neighbors.

1

One day he went and built a home way out in the bush, far from the homes of his neighbors.

2

He would go out every day in the morning and come home late at night.

3

One night the man was very late getting home.
A hyena saw what that man was doing.

4

The hyena went and knocked on the door of the house.

5

The woman, thinking it was her husband, opened the door. 
The hyena jumped on her and devoured her.

6

The man, when he returned home saw that his wife had been eaten by a hyena. 
There was nothing he could say.

7

All this happened because he didn’t want to live near his neighbours.
