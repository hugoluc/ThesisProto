The Man and
the Lion
Mozambican folktale
English

Once upon a time, there was a man walking in the bush.
Suddenly he met a lion!

1

The lion was resting in the short winter grass.

2

The meeting was so sudden that the man did not know what to do.
He was full of fear.

3

At first, the lion was surprised too, and a little afraid.
But there was a low rumble in his stomach, because he was hungry.

4

The man suddenly found himself up a tall tree.
He began to shout at the lion.

5

The lion lay down under the tree, waiting for his meal.
As time went on, the lion fell asleep, or so it seemed.

6

Soon the man fell asleep.
Then he woke up again.
Finally he dozed off and went fast asleep.

7

But then he crashed down on the sleeping lion!

8

They both woke up confused and frightened.
The lion forgot his meal and ran for his life.

9

The man began to run in the same direction as the lion.
Then he realized that he was running with the lion!

10

So he changed direction and escaped being eaten by the lion!
