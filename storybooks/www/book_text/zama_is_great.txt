Zama is great!
Michael Oguttu

My little brother sleeps very late.
I wake early, because I am great!

1

I am the one who lets in the sun.

2

“You’re my morning star,” says Ma.

3

I wash myself, I don't need any help.

4

I can cope with cold water and blue smelly soap.

5

Ma reminds, "Don't forget teeth." 
I reply, "Never, not me!"

6

After washing, I greet Grandpa and Auntie, and wish them a good day.

7

Then I dress myself, “I’m big now Ma,” I say.

8

I can close my buttons and buckle my shoes.

9

And I make sure little brother knows all theschool news.

10

In class I do my best in every way.

11

I do all these good things every day.
But the thing I like most, is to play and play!
