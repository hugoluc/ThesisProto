Letter to mum


Mother was finishing packing her clothes in a small bag.

1

As she went out the door, she hugged me and said, “Bye for now.”

2

“Where are you going, mum?” 
I looked up at her as I asked.

3

I started to cry wanting to follow her 
but dad lifted me up on his shoulder.

4

Dad said, “Your mother is going to the hospital to have a baby.”

5

When I heard “baby” I stopped crying and looked at him.
“Why is she going to get the baby from the hospital?” I asked him.

6

Dad sat me on a small chair and said, 
“I will tell you why she is going to get the baby from the hospital.”

7

I listened keenly to him as he explained although I didn’t
quite understand why she wasn’t having the baby at home.
When dad finished explaining I asked, 
“Will she still love me when she comes back with the other baby?”

8

My dad held me close and said,
“We will always love you.”

9

“Can I write a letter to her while she is there?” I asked dad.

10

That evening, I began to write a letter to mum.

11

I tore a paper from my exercise book and began to write:

12

“Mummy, mummy, dad said that you have gone to bring another baby.

13

Please hurry up and return home.

14

I want you to bring a baby girl so I can play with her when she grows up.

15

You can bring two so one can be mine.

16

I am waiting for you here outside our house.”

17

I folded my letter so I could give it to my father to bring it to mum.

When I woke up the following morning, the letter was gone.
