Vayu, the wind
Madhuri Pai and Rohini Nilekani

Every time I finish my hot, hot bath.
My wet body feels so cool, cool, cool.
What makes that happen?
Vayu, the wind!

1

The milk in my cup - too hot, too hot.
But soon it is ready for me to gulp.
Who makes that happen?
Vayu, the wind!

2

The window curtains flutter and gently brush my face.
Who makes it happen?
Vayu, the wind!

3

A bolt of lightning far away.
Black clouds moving my way.
Who makes that happen?
Vayu, the wind!

4

Branches sway and leaves tremble.
Flowers gently fall.
Who did it all?
Vayu, the wind!

5

Far from the house, we are playing, yet, I can smell the sweets mother is preparing.
Who makes it happen?
Vayu, the wind!

6

A glass tumbler on a windowsill, crashes on the ground.
I am glad I was not around.
Who played this mischief?
Of course, it was Vayu, the wind!

7

A whistle blows. A train rolls in.
I cannot see, but hear its din.
Who makes that happen?
Vayu, the wind!

8

Cannot be seen.
Cannot be heard.
Does all the work without a word.
Who can it be?
Of course!
The wind!
