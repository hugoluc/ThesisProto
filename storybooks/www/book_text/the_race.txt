The Race

One day the rabbit found a snail. 
He said to the snail, “You can't run! All you know is how to crawl in the soil.”

1

The snail says, “You come on Sunday and you will see.”

2

The snail prepared a hundred bits of paper and wrote some words on them, 
but the message was always the same.

3

The snail handed out the papers to his friends and said, 
“When the rabbit comes here calling me, one of you must say: I am the snail.”

4

Then the snail told his friends to hide behind the bushes where the rabbit and the snail will pass.

5

On Sunday the rabbit arrived and found the snail. 
The rabbit says, “Let´s have a race. But I will win.”

6

So the snail hid behind the bush and let the rabbit run. 
During the race, the rabbit called out, “Snail, snail!”

7

And one of the snails hidden behind the bushes answered, 
“I am the snail, I am the snail.”

8

Finally, the rabbit was very tired and he lay down, saying, 
“Snail, I am so tired; you have won.”

9

So the snail won because of his cleverness!
