The Staring
Game
Mozambican folktale
English

A long time ago, the rabbit and the snake were good friends.

1

One day they began to chat with each other.
But the rabbit was much cleverer than the snake, and the snake knew it!

2

So, they were discussing who could stare the longest. The snake said:
Let's try it. 
I will win by staring at you.
So the rabbit agreed to the staring game.

3

The snake and the rabbit began to stare.
They kept on doing it for several minutes.

4

Then the snake got tired. 
So he got out of his body and only his skin was left looking at the rabbit.

5

The rabbit continued looking at the snake's skin for several hours.

6

The rabbit thought he was the cleverest animal, but on that day, his cleverness was ended. 
And that's why to this day the rabbit sleeps with his eyes open!
